## Behavior

Four independent 2-input NAND gates:

```
y[i] = ~(a[i] & b[i])     for i in 0..3
```

Truth table (per gate):

| a | b | y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

## Ports

| Signal | Width | Direction | Description                                |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `a`    | [3:0] | in        | A input of each of the four gates          |
| `b`    | [3:0] | in        | B input of each of the four gates          |
| `y`    | [3:0] | out       | Output of each of the four NAND gates      |

`a[i]`/`b[i]` map to the A and B input of gate *i*, with `y[i]` the output.

## DIP-14 pin mapping

| Pin | Signal | Pin | Signal |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| 1   | a[0]   | 14  | Vcc    |
| 2   | b[0]   | 13  | b[3]   |
| 3   | y[0]   | 12  | a[3]   |
| 4   | a[1]   | 11  | y[3]   |
| 5   | b[1]   | 10  | b[2]   |
| 6   | y[1]   | 9   | a[2]   |
| 7   | GND    | 8   | y[2]   |

Vcc and GND are not RTL signals; they describe the physical chip.

## FPGA synthesis

Pure combinational, no clock or reset. Synthesizes to four LUT2s (or fewer
if the synthesis tool merges them with downstream logic).

## What is *not* modeled

The 74x00 has no analog, tri-state, or open-collector behavior, so there are
no unsupported physical features for this part.

## Testbench

`tb/chips/ttl_74x00/tb_ttl_74x00.sv` exhaustively walks all 256 input
patterns (4 a-bits × 4 b-bits) and checks each gate's output against the
NAND truth table.
