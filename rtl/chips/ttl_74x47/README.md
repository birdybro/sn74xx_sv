# ttl_74x47 — BCD to 7-segment decoder/driver, OC 15 V, active-low outputs

The classic seven-segment driver for common-anode LED displays.

## Ports

| Signal      | Width | Dir | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-----|-------|
| `bcd`       | [3:0] | in  | BCD value, 0..15. `bcd[3]` is the MSB. |
| `lt_n`      | 1     | in  | Lamp test (active low) — when 0 (and `bi_n=1`), every segment lights. |
| `bi_n`      | 1     | in  | Blanking input (active low) — when 0, all segments off and `rbo_n` drops. |
| `rbi_n`     | 1     | in  | Ripple blanking input (active low) — when 0 and `bcd=0`, blank the digit and drive `rbo_n` low. |
| `seg_n[6:0]`| 7     | out | Segment outputs in order {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}, **active low**. |
| `rbo_n`     | 1     | out | Ripple blanking output (active low). |

On the real chip, `bi_n` and `rbo_n` share a single bidirectional pin. In
RTL they are separate ports so the module can be driven correctly and the
ripple chain can be wired explicitly.

## Truth-table priority

1. `bi_n=0` — all segments off, `rbo_n=0`.
2. `bi_n=1`, `lt_n=0` — all segments lit, `rbo_n=1`.
3. `bi_n=1`, `lt_n=1`, `rbi_n=0`, `bcd=0` — all segments off, `rbo_n=0`.
4. Otherwise — normal hex decode, `rbo_n=1`.

For `bcd` in 0..9 the decode produces the standard digit patterns.
For `bcd` in A..F the chip produces the datasheet-defined "partial
patterns" (see RTL `case`), with `F` producing all-blank.

## Testbench

Walks all 16 BCD values × 8 control input combinations = 128 vectors,
checking each against the truth-table-derived expected output.
